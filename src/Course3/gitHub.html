            Application developers rarely work alone. Large web/cloud/mobile development and data science projects will
            include many people â€“ front-end developers, back-end developers, database administrators, repository
            administrators, and others. Every change by every contributor must be tracked and controlled to enable
            collaboration, accountability, and version management. This type of distributed version control is extremely
            important when managing both small and large software projects. In this module, you will learn about some of
            the popular version control tools, create a GitHub account, and use the GitHub web interface to create a
            repository, add a file to it, and commit your changes. Branches are the heart of workflows in Git-based
            version control systems like GitHub. You will also become familiar with creating and using branches and
            merging your changes to the main branch.

                <li>GitHub - Getting Started</li>

        <li>Git Commands and Managing GitHub Projects</li>
        <ul>
            <li>As you start working with GitHub repositories and automating workflows, using the web interface can be
                limiting and more time-consuming. This is where Git commands come in. You can use it from your own
                desktop, or a virtual desktop provided through the Cloud IDE - wherever you develop your code. In this
                module, you will become familiar with and utilize various Git commands to clone and fork repositories,
                as well as commit, push, and pull your changes using the command line.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Now that you are familiar working with GitHub repositories, Branches, and Git commands, in this module
                you will apply your knowledge and skills to create a GitHub Project, add few files to it such as an
                open-source license, and share it publicly.</li>
