    <h1>Get Started with Cloud Native, DevOps, Agile, and NoSQL</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduction to Cloud Native</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Do you want to learn about developing cloud native applications from conception to implementation? This
                module will begin with some fundamental cloud concepts. Then you'll get into specific tools and
                techniques
                for creating cloud native applications. You will also learn about the Cloud Native Computing Foundation,
                the
                importance of hybrid cloud infrastructures, and how they affect cloud app developers. Then you'll look
                at
                two important aspects of cloud thinking: modernization and continuous integration/continuous delivery.
            </li>

                <li>Welcome to Developing Cloud Native Applications</li>
                <li>Cloud Computing Overview</li>
                <li>Cloud Native Applications</li>
                <li>CNCF</li>
                <li>Hybrid Cloud (Optional)</li>
                <li>Modernizing with Cloud Native Technologies</li>
            </ul>

                Are you looking to improve your organizational culture and automate the stages of app development? In
                this
                module, you will begin by discovering how adopting a DevOps culture will aid in the collaboration of
                development and operations engineers throughout the development lifecycle. Then you’ll experiment with
                different ways of working, such as using test-driven and behavior-driven development techniques to
                ensure
                repeatable behavior and high code quality. Test-driven development (TDD) allows you to develop more
                quickly
                and confidently. In contrast, Behavior Driven Development (BDD) tests the system’s behavior from the
                outside
                and ensures that it behaves as intended. You’ll then see how implementing Continuous Integration and
                Continuous Delivery practices guarantees that every change contributes to a potentially shippable
                feature.
                You will also learn about the fundamental DevOps and CI/CD tools developers use worldwide. Then you’ll
                discover why empowering people to do their best work contributes to the organizational DevOps goal of
                achieving a shared mindset and empowering everyone to deliver customer value.

                framework for applying Agile principles to project management. You'll also learn more about Agile
                iterative planning, how businesses can use Agile to organize for success, and how team alignment and
                autonomy help develop better systems. You'll also learn how to create and refine a product backlog,
                write compelling user stories, estimate and assign story points, and plan a sprint. Finally, you'll
                discover how to conduct sprint reviews and retrospectives.
