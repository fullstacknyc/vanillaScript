    <h1>JavaScript Programming Essentials</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduction to JavaScript Development</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In this module, you will learn about introductory JavaScript development concepts. You will learn the
                basics of software development, including the evolution of JavaScript with ES6, which standardized the
                JavaScript language. You will explore variables and data types in JavaScript. You will acquire an
                understanding of operators and expressions with the help of examples. You will study different types of
                functions and concepts, such as closure and hoisting. You will get oriented to ECMAScript. Finally, you
                will learn about events in JavaScript and their triggers to make dynamic web pages.</li>

            <li>In this module, you will learn about arrays and objects. You will first acquire a strong understanding
                of arrays and gain practical skills in creating, manipulating, and iterating arrays. You will learn
                about various JavaScript array methods and explore two-dimensional arrays. Additionally, you will gain a
                clear understanding of classes and objects in JavaScript and learn about accessing object properties.
                Youâ€™ll explore various string manipulation techniques and recognize the importance of the math object in
                JavaScript and the use of date objects.</li>

            <li>In this module, you will learn about debugging techniques and tools in JavaScript. In lesson 1, you will
                explore more about the Try-catch block as a debugging tool. You will get oriented to the working of the
                DOM
                and its various nodes. You will study various methods to access and manipulate DOM elements. In lesson
                2,
                you will learn key components of the Browser Object Model (BOM) and how to use them in an HTML file.
                Next,
                you will understand different traversing methods and techniques using examples. You also learn how to
                style
                the DOM to change its visual representation.</li>

                lesson 1, you will also be able to differentiate between JSON and object. You will understand
                asynchronous and synchronous programming using examples. You will also learn the key difference between
                asynchronous and synchronous programming. You will explore the history and evolution of Asynchronous
                JavaScript and XML (AJAX). You will acquire knowledge of best practices to implement AJAX in
                development. You will also learn the features and functionalities of XMLHttpRequest with examples. In
                lesson 2, you will learn callbacks using an example. You will also learn about promises, their three
                states, syntax, and advantages. You will explore the characteristics of fetch API and its different
                methods to interact with data on web resources. You will also learn about Axios and its syntax using an
                example. You will be able to differentiate between Axios and fetch API.</li>
