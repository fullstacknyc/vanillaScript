    <h1>Developing Front-End Apps with React</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduction to React and Class Components</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In this module, you begin exploring frameworks and their use in React web development. You will start by
                comparing libraries and frameworks and then explore front-end frameworks further by learning about
                prominent features of React. Additionally, the module will introduce the Vite build tool for React
                project creation and guide you through setting up a React application. Understanding the directory
                structure will streamline your workflow. Additionally, the module will cover EcmaScript6 (ES6), and JSX
                fundamentals, including syntax and compilation, empowering you to create dynamic React components
                effortlessly. Moving forward, you will delve into the concepts of state management, using props, and
                handling events for each type. Finally, you will master the concept of state and props, understanding
                how data flows within your components.</li>

        </ul>
        <li>Understanding Function Components with Array and DOM Manipulation</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In this module, you will learn concepts for building dynamic React applications, including function
                components, arrays, and using the virtual DOM. The first lesson begins with exploring props, default
                props, and event handling to pass data and create interactions between components. Next, you'll delve
                into component composition, learning its principles through practical examples. You'll also gain a solid
                understanding of state management in function components. Additionally, you'll become proficient in
                utilizing the useState hook to manipulate component states efficiently. In lesson two, you will explore
                arrays in React components and the virtual DOM. By the end of this module, you will be able to build web
                applications using React's array handling and the virtual DOM.</li>
