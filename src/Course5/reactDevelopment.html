    <h1>Developing Front-End Apps with React</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduction to React and Class Components</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In this module, you begin exploring frameworks and their use in React web development. You will start by
                comparing libraries and frameworks and then explore front-end frameworks further by learning about
                prominent features of React. Additionally, the module will introduce the Vite build tool for React
                project creation and guide you through setting up a React application. Understanding the directory
                structure will streamline your workflow. Additionally, the module will cover EcmaScript6 (ES6), and JSX
                fundamentals, including syntax and compilation, empowering you to create dynamic React components
                effortlessly. Moving forward, you will delve into the concepts of state management, using props, and
                handling events for each type. Finally, you will master the concept of state and props, understanding
                how data flows within your components.</li>

        <li>Understanding Function Components with Array and DOM Manipulation</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In this module, you will learn concepts for building dynamic React applications, including function
                components, arrays, and using the virtual DOM. The first lesson begins with exploring props, default
                props, and event handling to pass data and create interactions between components. Next, you'll delve
                into component composition, learning its principles through practical examples. You'll also gain a solid
                understanding of state management in function components. Additionally, you'll become proficient in
                utilizing the useState hook to manipulate component states efficiently. In lesson two, you will explore
                arrays in React components and the virtual DOM. By the end of this module, you will be able to build web
                applications using React's array handling and the virtual DOM.</li>

        <li>In-depth Understanding of Advanced React Functionality</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In the first lesson of this module, you will explore React hooks and their use for form management. You
                will also learn how to retrieve data from third-party external services and process it using the forms
                you build. In the second lesson, you learn Redux library core concepts, such as using actions, the Redux
                store, and reducers to manage the state of entire applications. You also explore the advantages and
                Redux use cases. The module will also address the challenges associated with using a synchronous tool
                such as Redux and how to overcome them using libraries such as Saga and Thunk. Furthermore, the lesson
                will introduce Redux Toolkit, a suite of utilities designed to simplify Redux tasks and streamline state
                management in your React applications.</li>

        <li>Practice, Final Project, and Peer Review Assignment</li>
        <ul>
            <li>You will create a React shopping cart app for your final project in the final module. You receive a
                grade on the project through a peer evaluation. You will also evaluate one of your peerâ€™s projects using
                a rubric with objective grading criteria. You will apply and integrate many skills learned in the
                instructional modules, including creating functional components and updating those components using
                states and hooks. You will use Redux to manage states within your application using actions, reducers,
                and the store. The project architecture allows you to compose components using a nesting structure. You
                will also manage side effects with useEffect hooks. You will handle user events to render fetched data
                from an array and trigger corresponding actions. This module has a practice project that will assist you
                with developing the required components and functionality in the final project.</li>
