        <li>SDLC - The Software Development Cycle</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This module provides you with an overview to the field of software engineering. In the first lesson of this module, you will be introduced to the field of software engineering, and learn about the software development lifecycle (SDLC), elements of building high-quality software, and writing requirements. In lesson two you will explore different approaches to building software and different career opportunities related to software development. You will also hear from experienced practitioners in the field and learn how different roles interact and work with each other as a team in order to develop enterprise-level software.</li>

        <li>Introduction to Software Development</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This module introduces you to the concepts of application development. In lesson 1 you’ll learn about the differences in front-end and back-end development in web and cloud applications and the technologies used in both. You’ll also learn about how working in teams and pairs can enhance the development process and make it more efficient. In lesson 2 you will explore many of the application development tools that a software engineer uses to write, test, and release code and be introduced to software stacks that support the execution of an application. Finally, in the hands-on lab, you’ll learn how to use an integrated development environment (IDE) to develop and run code.</li>

        <li>Basics of Programming</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This module introduces you to the basics of programming. In the first lesson, you will learn about the different categories of programming languages and the scenarios to which each is suited. You’ll also learn how to plan and organize your code effectively. In lesson 2 you will explore basic programming logic and investigate programming concepts such as identifiers, functions, and objects. Finally, in the hands-on lab, you’ll learn how to write simple Python code.</li>

        <li>Software Architecture, Design, and Patterns</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In this module, you will learn about the foundations of enterprise software development. Lesson 1 introduces you to software architecture and explains the importance of well-designed architecture. You will also learn about the design process, including structural design, behavioral models, and how you can create unified modeling language (UML) diagrams to communicate a software’s structure and behavior to all team members. You will also consider object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). In Lesson 2 you will explore a variety of architectural patterns that support the architectural design process in a hands-on activity. Lastly, you will learn about the software production environment and some of the components required for deployment.</li>
