    <h1>Introduction to Containers w/ Docker, Kubernetes & OpenShift</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Containers and Containerization</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Start your first week by learning about container concepts, features, use cases, and benefits. Building
                on your new knowledge of containers, you’ll learn what Docker does and discover why Docker is a winner
                with developers. You’ll learn what Docker is, become acquainted with Docker processes, and explore
                Docker’s underlying technology. Learn about how developers and organizations can benefit from using
                Docker and see which situations are challenging for using Docker. Next, learn how to build a container
                image using a Dockerfile, how to create a running container using that image, become familiar with the
                Docker command line interface (CLI), and explore frequently used Docker commands. You’ll become
                knowledgeable about Docker objects, Dockerfile commands, container image naming, and learn how Docker
                uses networks, storage, and plugins. Then, assimilate this knowledge when you see Docker architecture
                components in action and explore containerization using Docker. At the end of this first week, you’ll
                pull an image from a Docker Hub registry. You’ll run an image as a container using Docker, build and tag
                an image using a Dockerfile, and push that image to a registry. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduction to Containers</li>
                    <li>Introduction to Docker</li>
                    <li>Building and Running Container Images</li>
                    <li>Docker Objects</li>
                    <li>Docker Architecture</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Kubernetes Basics</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In week two, learn what container orchestration is. Then, explore how developers can use container
                orchestration to create and manage complex container environment development lifecycles. Kubernetes is
                currently the most popular container orchestration platform. You’ll examine key Kubernetes architectural
                components, including control plane components and controllers. Explore Kubernetes objects, and learn
                how specific Kubernetes objects such as Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments work. Then, learn how
                developers use the Kubernetes command line interface (CLI), or “kubectl” to manipulate objects, manage
                workloads in a Kubernetes cluster, and apply basic kubectl commands. You’ll be able to differentiate the
                benefits and drawbacks of using imperative and declarative commands. At the end of this module, you will
                use the kubectl CLI commands to create resources on an actual Kubernetes cluster. At the end of this
                week, you’ll use the Kubernetes CLI to create a Kubernetes pod, create a Kubernetes deployment, create a
                ReplicaSet and see Kubernetes load balancing in action.</li>

                    <li>Container Orchestration</li>
                    <li>Introduction to Kubernetes</li>
                    <li>Kubernetes Architecture</li>
                    <li>Kubernetes Objects - Part 1</li>
                    <li>Kubernetes Objects - Part 2</li>
                    <li>Using Kubectl</li>

                </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Managing Applications with Kubernetes</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In week three, you’ll explore ReplicaSets, autoscaling, rolling updates, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and
                service bindings, and learn how you can use these capabilities to manage Kubernetes applications. You’ll
                learn how ReplicaSets scale applications to meet increasing demand, and how autoscaling creates dynamic
                demand-based scaling. You’ll see how to use rolling updates to publish application updates and roll back
                changes without interrupting the user experience. You’ll learn how to use ConfigMaps and Secrets to
                provide configuration variables and sensitive information to your deployments and to keep your code
                clean. At the end of the week, you’ll scale and update applications deployed in Kubernetes.</li>

        </ul>
        <li>The Kubernetes Ecosystem: OpenShift, Istio, etc.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In week four, you’ll learn more about the growing Kubernetes ecosystem and explore additional tools that
                work well with Kubernetes to support cloud-native development. You’ll gain an understanding of the
                similarities and differences between Red Hat ® OpenShift® and Kubernetes and see what OpenShift
                architecture looks like. You’ll learn about OpenShift builds and BuildConfigs, and OpenShift build
                strategies and triggers. You'll also discover how operators can deploy whole applications with ease.
                Finally, you’ll examine how the Istio service mesh manages and secures traffic and communication between
                an application’s services. At the end of the week, you’ll use the oc CLI to perform commands on an
                OpenShift cluster. And you’ll use the OpenShift build capabilities to deploy an application from source
                code stored in a Git repository.</li>
